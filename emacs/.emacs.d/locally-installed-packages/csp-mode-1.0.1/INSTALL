Installation of csp-mode requires the following steps:

1. Edit `Makefile' and adapt the pathnames to your systems'
   requirements.  Also pay attention on the variables that define some
   program names (f.e. your Emacs flavour `emacs' or `xemacs').

2. Run `make install' to byte-compile csp-mode for your Emacs flavour,
   install the byte-compiled files and the info documentation to the
   appropriate directories specified in the file `Makefile'.

   See `Makefile' for more detailled installation options (DVI or
   PostScript versions of the manual).

3. Add the following to your ~/.emacs:

   (require 'csp-mode)

4. Run your Emacs flavour and load a CSP specification.  You're
   supposed to look at a colorful CSP specification now.
